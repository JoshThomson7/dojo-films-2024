    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[ For sale : a deceptively spacious 3 bedroom town house in a quiet, sought-after location within the Kingswood development. The property is presented in move-in condition.

A hallway leads from the front to the back of the house. Off the hall is a shower room that includes a basin/WC and a utility room houses the gas combination boiler, a sink and has an external door to the garden.  At the back of the house a bedroom looks across the lawned rear garden. 
A staircase from the entrance hall extends to a landing. The first-floor lounge has a fireplace and a bright kitchen is fitted with an electric oven and the gas hob has an extractor hood over. In addition to a selection of base units and cupboards, the dishwasher is integrated and the floor is covered in ceramic tiles.

PLEASE SEE THE DETAILED FLOORPLAN, PHOTOS AND THE 360 DEGREE VIRTUAL TOUR TO GET THE FULL PICTURE.
Additional points of note include;
A five year electrical safety report was produced in 2021, a new hot water cylinder was fitted in 2020 9with a 25 yr guarantee) and the boiler has been serviced each year and has a current a gas safety certificate. An opportunity exists to convert the garage into an additional living space or a ground floor suite/bedroom. The plumbing already exists in the cloak area so this should be a straightforward conversion.
Offered for sale with vacant possession and no chain, an early viewing is strongly advised to avoid disappointment.

Selset Way, Kingswood is well positioned alongside a range of amenities including an ASDA superstore, Boots The Chemist, M&S Food, McDonalds, David Lloyd Leisure Centre, a cinema, a Next store and a Gino D'Acampo restaurant.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[ This beautiful property has been thoroughly improved and developed in all aspects to create a stunning semi-detached home in a very popular residential area to the west of the city. The plot is equally impressive setting the house well back from the road to the front and offering parking. A private, lawned garden at back has a tall garage served by easy ten-foot access.

The entrance hall hosts a striking, spindled staircase and leads into the 2 receptions and the kitchen. The traditional lounge has an angled bay and a contemporary fireplace and the 2nd reception is fitted to a high standard with a snug area and a dining space beyond in front of the patio doors opening to the rear garden. The kitchen has a selection of shiny white base units and mounted cupboards, a contrasting black sink and drainer, integrated appliances and a full height cupboard.

To the first floor, the main bedroom has an angled bay and double fitted wardrobes, the second bedroom is a further double room with an Ideal Logic boiler in a bespoke cupboard and the third bedroom is to the front of the house. The bathroom is a pleasant space with a full suite and a thermostatic shower over the bath.

The windows are fully double glazed, the loft space is insulated, the gas boiler fires the central heating and the hot water and is approximately 4 years old and the garage is independently alarmed.

PLEASE SEE THE DETAILED FLOOR PLAN, PHOTOS AND THE 360 DEGREE VIRTUAL TOUR TO GET THE FULL PICTURE.

Houses finished to this standard are rarely available to purchase, so an early viewing is strongly advised!

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[ This tremendous top floor, leasehold apartment offers unbroken views across the Marina and the river from a superb balcony to the front of this development. The opportunity to purchase one of the few sought-after top floor units is rare, so is a chance not to be missed.

The communal aspects are well maintained and internally the property has been fitted to a high standard with integrated appliances in the kitchen including an oven/hob, fridge freezer and a dishwasher in addition to a tiled floor and spotlights to ceiling.

The lounge has big windows and glazed doors opening to a glorious balcony. The bedroom is a double and also opens to the balcony. The bathroom has a bath with an overhead shower, a basin, WC and a large inset mirror. Both rooms benefit from extra natural light feeding in through triangular windows positioned close to the apex of the roof.

Good storage space is available on the landing in a deep, full height cupboard, an efficient electric heating system heats the apartment and the option of secure parking* makes this a hard act to beat.

As a place to live, The Hull Marina reaps all of the benefits of such a central location. Across a set of lock gates is the superb Fruit Market development that came to the forefront during the City of Culture celebrations. The Hull Royal Infirmary and Kingston Communications Stadium are also close by.

Good public transport links are on offer to the surrounding villages of Cottingham, Anlaby and Hessle and excellent road connections are available to all parts of the city with easy access to the M62 via the A63 dual carriageway

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[ So rarely does an opportunity arrive to buy a bright, spacious, genuine bungalow in such a great position. Set onto the end of an exclusive, tranquil cul-de-sac, the location is deceiving, as the centre of the village of North Ferriby is just minutes away. 

An external door to the front opens to an entrance hall. Off here is a bedroom with double fitted wardrobes and overhead cupboards. Adjacent to the bedroom is a shower room with a corner cubicle, a thermostatic shower and tiling. Turn left from the entrance hall and you're into a super dual-aspect lounge with a shallow angled bay and a contemporary fireplace. Stylish folding doors that give the option of opening up this space into a kitchen fitted with a selection of wooden base units and mounted cupboards, an integrated gas hob and extractor over a fan oven. There is good accommodation for the remaining appliances, the dishwasher is also integrated and a glazed door opens to the back.

A 2nd hallway from the lounge offers access through a hatch to boarded loft space and leads to 2 more double bedrooms and a full family bathroom. One of the bedrooms is fully fitted with wardrobes and high-level cupboards. The other has French doors opening to the back garden and a further door linking to the kitchen. In the bathroom, the shower is from the mixer tap and is positioned over the bath. A pedestal basin and WC complete the suite. The walls are fully-tiled and a window fitted with obscure glass lights up the space.

Lawned gardens to the front set the house well back from the kerbside. A long side drive from the offers parking for several vehicles and extends to a tidy brick garage with power sockets and light. At the back is a raised patio, lawn, flowerbeds and a sun house sits in pride snugly in the corner of the westerly-facing garden.

The property is in super condition, benefits from full uPVC double glazing and gas central heating, and provides a genuine turn-key opportunity.
